## Why PhysioZoo?

- **Data visualization**: graphical user interface which enables HRV analysis
  and data visualization without writing any code.

- **Reproducibility of research**: Human readable configuration files which
  contain all the parameters of the peak detectors, preprocessing routines and
  HRV measures. This file is self containing and ensure research can be
  reproduced using this configuration file and the original data.

- **Algorithmic toolbox**: Completely scriptable for embedding into your custom
  processing code.

- **Open-source collaborative platform**: Both the source code and
  documentation are not only freely available, they're also easy to modify and
  update using git and GitHub.

## How to contribute?

The **PhysioZoo** project is dynamic and so novel contributions are welcomed.
You can contribute by:

  * **Fork it** fork the repository on the  project's main page

  * **Create a pull request** contribute algorithms and improvements to the
    **PhysioZoo** toolbox

  * **Bugs!** In case you in encounter a bug and cannot figure out the
    solution, please have a look at the [issues
    page](https://github.com/physiozoo/physiozoo/issues) and don't hesitate to
    open a new issue if you can't find an answer.

  * **Pitch in your new ideas** for future releases by suggesting an
    enhancement.

## Benefits of Contributing

Collaborative research has various benefits, here are some of those:

- Enable other researchers to contribute, debug and build on your work
- Advertise your research, published algorithms are linked in the documentation
- Ensure reproducibility of your results
